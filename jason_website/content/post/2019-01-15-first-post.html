<p>This is the first post on my website. I’ll be exploring R on this website for the most part and perhaps also show some stuff in my life.</p>
<div id="my-path-to-r" class="section level2">
<h2>My path to R</h2>
<p>I did a Masters of Public Health at UC Davis from 2017-2018.</p>
<p>My peers and I all had to learn SAS for our biostatistics courses. Using SAS, we could manipulate the data and then run some statistical tests and analyses.</p>
<p>It was our first introduction to SAS and things were tricky due to our lack of programming or statistical background.</p>
<p>I also then learned and used some Stata for another class.</p>
<p>But after I graduated from my MPH program, I no longer had access to neither SAS or Stata because they are both proprietry software.</p>
</div>
<div id="enter-r.-its-free" class="section level2">
<h2>Enter R. It’s free!</h2>
<p>Throughout my MPH, I had heard of this R. My classmate, Zach, had used it for his Nutrition Masters Program and had stated his preference for R over SAS. “SAS is stupid!”</p>
<p>But only when I really had R as the only option did I use it.</p>
</div>
<div id="beginning-of-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Beginning of R</h2>
<p>I used R to analyze survey data at Knights Landing. Manipulating the data was the hard part before some simple statistical analyses such as ANOVA or t-tests.</p>
<p>The process of learning R can be tricky and was much different from SAS.</p>
<p>R is an open-source language and it definitely can be positive or negative.</p>
<div id="thoughts-about-r" class="section level4">
<h4>Thoughts about R</h4>

<li>Multiple Methods</li>
<li>Additional Features: Blogging, Notebooks and etc.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="multiple-methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Multiple Methods</h3>
<p>There are several methods to do the same thing. For example manipulating data, you can use base R, dplyr or data.table. For graphing, you can use base R or ggplot2.</p>
<p>The options you can use are so common.</p>
<p>But I’d also have to say. Use stackexchange. It’s so useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-features-blogging-notebooks-and-etc." class="section level3">
<h3>Additional Features: Blogging, Notebooks and etc.</h3>
<p>There are several awesome packages with other functionality.</p>
<p>R markdown is a great interactive document. So useful.</p>
<p><code>blogdown</code> allows for building websites.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="other-notes" class="section level2">
<h2>Other Notes</h2>
<p>Also some R authors or people should be followed especially Hadley and Yihui Xie. They both authored some great packages and have documented them with thorough instructions and tips.</p>
</div>
<div id="join-r-jobs-hobbies-fun-stuff" class="section level2">
<h2>Join R (Jobs / Hobbies / Fun Stuff)</h2>
<p>After learning R, I actually really enjoy using it.</p>
<p>It will be useful for getting a job (it’s been helpful).</p>
<p>It can built interactive documents and analyze things.</p>
</div>
